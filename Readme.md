# Python II Assignments
Assignments are located [here](Assignments.md).

# Solutions

This branch contains solutions for each exercise! In the `src` directory, you will find that each exercise has its own file.

- ***Each exercise file will contain the function and/or you were asked to build along with a test case.***

***NOTE:*** I went beyond what was asked for exercise 9 and created a health (HP) and hit points (damage) system so each game character can do varying damages. The underlying concepts remain the same.

Hope this helps you understand Python better!
